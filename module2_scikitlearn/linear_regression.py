# Linear Models - Regressors in Scikit-Learn
# For linear models, there are many estimator classes which are very close to each other. Let us have a look at
# • LinearRegression, no penalty
# • Ridge, L2 penalty
# • Lasso, LI penalty (sparse models)
# • ElasticNet, L1 + L2 penalty (less sparse models)
# • SGDRegressor With loss='squared_loss'
